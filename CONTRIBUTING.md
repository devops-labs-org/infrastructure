# Contributing to Infrastructure Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this infrastructure repository.

Please follow the guidelines below to keep the system safe and stable.

# Allowed changes

- Infrastructure as Code files
- Cloud, network, and system configurations
- Automation or maintenance scripts
- Infrastructure documentation
- Security or compliance related updates

# Changes that are not allowed

- Application or frontend source code
- Secrets such as passwords or API keys

# How to make changes

1. Always create a separate branch from `main`
2. Keep your change small and focused on one thing
3. Verify the change works before committing
4. Write commit messages that clearly describe the change
5. Raise a Pull Request with a clear explanation

# Pull Request rules

- One Pull Request should cover only one logical change
- The PR description must explain both what was changed and why
- Every Pull Request must be reviewed before merging
- Direct commits to the `main` branch are not permitted

Wrong infrastructure changes can cause outages, security risks, and hard-to-fix failures, so following these rules keeps production systems safe.
